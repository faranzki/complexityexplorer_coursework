# complexityexplorer_coursework
My solutions to tasks from online courses which I am taking with the complexity explorer by the Santa Fe Institute.

I am currently taking the 'Introduction to dynamical systems and chaos' by Dave Feldman
(https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/71-introduction-to-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-fall-2017)
and the 'Nonlinear dynamics: Mathematical and computational approaches'
(https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/79-nonlinear-dynamics-mathematical-and-computational-approaches-fall-2017).

The aim of this repository is to share and compare the solutions to the tasks with other students taking these courses.
